"The true Christmas message is so often lost in the busyness and profit-making venues during the holiday season. How does one wade through all of the worldly diversions and still find Christ? Drawing from a lifetime of writings and sermons"," beloved preacher and author Billy Graham pierces through the meaningless activity we get caught up in by taking readers back to the time when heaven descended to earth—and the place where Christ was born. Included in this classic Christmas message are excerpts from This Christmas Night","Invalid ISBN Provided"

"In Miracle at Coney Island: How a Sideshow Doctor Saved Thousands of Babies and Transformed American Medicine"," Claire Prentice uncovers the incredible true story of Martin Couney","Invalid ISBN Provided"
"Couney ran his incubator facility for premature babies at Coney Island from 1903 to 1943 and set up similar exhibits at World’s Fairs and amusement parks across America"," and in London","Invalid ISBN Provided"
"Couney’s techniques were advanced for the time and his facility was expensive to run. But he didn’t charge the parents of the preemies a penny; instead the public paid to see them. He claimed to have a survival rate of 85 percent. By contrast"," most mainstream doctors in the early part of the 20th century regarded premature babies as “weaklings” and did little or nothing to save them.","Invalid ISBN Provided"
"Prentice’s meticulous research unravels the mystery of Couney’s origins"," and reveals that the “incubator doctor” was not all that he seemed. She brings one of the most extraordinary stories in American medicine to life through interviews with Couney’s former “incubator babies.”""","Invalid ISBN Provided"
