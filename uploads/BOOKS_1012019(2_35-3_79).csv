This guide is designed to help people deliberate together about how we should approach the issue. The three options presented here reflect different ways of understanding what is at stake and force us to think about what matters most to us when we face difficult problems that involve all of us and that do not have perfect solutions.

This issue guide presents the following three options for deliberation: 

Option 1: Welcome Immigrants, Be a Beacon of Freedom 

This option says that immigration has helped make America what it is today- a dynamic and diverse culture, an engine of the global economy, and a beacon of freedom around the world.

Option 2: Enforce the Law, Be Fair to Those Who Follow the Rules

This option says we need a fair system, where the rules are clear and, above all, enforced. With an estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally, our current system is unjust and uncontrolled.

Option 3: Slow Down and Rebuild Our Common Bonds 

This option recognizes that newcomers have strengthened American culture in the past. But the current levels of immigration are so high, and the country is now so diverse, that we must regain our sense of national purpose and identity.",Paperback,23 p. : 10.75 H x 0.25 D x 8.50 W inches 0.25 lbs.,1,,ENG,GENERAL,Non-Fiction,304,JV,,Sociology,"SOCIAL SCIENCE / Emigration & Immigration

Beowulf first rescues the royal house of Denmark from two marauding monsters, then returns to rule his people for 50 years, ultimately losing life in a battle to defend the Geats from a dragon's rampage. The poem combines mythical elements, Christian and pagan sensibilities, and actual historical figures and events in a narrative that ranges from vivid descriptions of fierce fighting and detailed portrayals of court life to earnest considerations of social and moral dilemmas.

Beginning with a violent and impassioned energy, this anthem ultimately offers little consolation.

But a dead man coming back to life? In our sophisticated age, when myth has given way to science, who can take such a claim seriously? Some argue that Jesus never died on the cross. Conflicting accounts make the empty tomb seem suspect.

According to one research program, anxiety-related issues are the number one mental health problem among women and are second only to alcohol and drug abuse among men. Stress-related ailments cost the nation $300 billion every year in medical bills and lost productivity. And use of sedative drugs like Xanax and Valium have skyrocketed in the last 15 years. Even students are feeling it. One psychologist reports that the average high school kid today has the same level of anxiety as the average psychiatric patient in the early 1950s. Chances are, you or someone you know seriously struggles with anxiety.
Max writes, ""The news about our anxiety is enough to make us anxious.” He knows what it feels like to be overcome by the worries and fear of life, which is why he is dedicated to helping millions of readers take back control of their minds and, as a result, their lives.
This 64-page booklet features practical steps from Max Lucado to help readers overcome anxiety. Eleven weekly reminders in all, each segment includes a Scripture verse for meditation, and a prayer to reframe anxious thoughts.
This booklet includes a passage from the book, Anxious for Nothing, by New York Times bestselling author Max Lucado. The small trim and low price point make this booklet easy to share with friends and family who are struggling with anxiety and need a fresh perspective on how to face it.

The realization of our moral debt sends some people into a frenzy of good works. Life becomes an unending quest to do enough, be better, accomplish more. A pursuit of piety. We attend church, tend to the sick, go on pilgrimages, and go on fasts. Yet deep within is the gnawing fear, What if, having done all that, I’ve not done enough?
Other people respond to the list, not with activity, but unbelief. They throw up their hands and walk away exasperated. No God would demand so much. He can’t be pleased. He can’t be satisfied. He must not exist. If he does exist, he is not worth knowing.
Two extremes. The legalist and the atheist. The worker desperate to impress God. The unbeliever convinced there is no God. Can you relate to either of the two? Do you know the weariness that comes from legalism? Do you know the loneliness that comes from atheism?
What do we do? Are despair and disbelief the only options?

In Miracle at Coney Island: How a Sideshow Doctor Saved Thousands of Babies and Transformed American Medicine, Claire Prentice uncovers the incredible true story of Martin Couney, the “incubator doctor.”
Couney ran his incubator facility for premature babies at Coney Island from 1903 to 1943 and set up similar exhibits at World’s Fairs and amusement parks across America, and in London, Paris, Mexico and Brazil.
Couney’s techniques were advanced for the time and his facility was expensive to run. But he didn’t charge the parents of the preemies a penny; instead the public paid to see them. He claimed to have a survival rate of 85 percent. By contrast, most mainstream doctors in the early part of the 20th century regarded premature babies as “weaklings” and did little or nothing to save them.
Prentice’s meticulous research unravels the mystery of Couney’s origins, and reveals that the “incubator doctor” was not all that he seemed. She brings one of the most extraordinary stories in American medicine to life through interviews with Couney’s former “incubator babies.”",Spoken Word MP3-CD,6.75 H x 0.25 D x 5.50 W inches 0.80 lbs.,1,,ENG,AUDIO,Non-Fiction,974,F,,History/American,"HISTORY / United States / State & Local / Middle Atlantic (DC, DE, MD, NJ, NY, PA)",null,Book,SPOKEN,,3/17/2017

Sins such as jealousy, anger, pride, judgmentalism, and unthankfulness are addressed in this booklet.

Just thinking about raising responsible, well-rounded kids sends a sobering shiver of responsibility right up the old parental spine.

But all is not so bleak. There’s hope, shining beacon-bright, at the end of the tunnel of parental frustration. Parenting doesn’t have to be drudgery. Children can grow to be thinking, responsible adults. This booklet, excerpted and adapted from the best-selling Parenting with Love and Logic, was designed to help parents and kids establish a rewarding relationship built on love and trust. What a deal!

The author's restless spirit, taste for a life of excitement, and probing mind led him on a series of hard-edged adventures from the Klondike to the South Seas. Out of these sometimes harrowing experiences — and his fascination with the theories of such thinkers as Darwin, Spencer, and Marx — came the inspiration for novels of adventure that would make him one of America’s most popular writers.
The Call of the Wild, considered by many London's greatest novel, is a gripping tale of a heroic dog that, thrust into the brutal life of the Alaska Gold Rush, ultimately faces a choice between living in man's world and returning to nature.

The story begins when a governess arrives at an English country estate to look after Miles, aged ten, and Flora, eight. At first, everything appears normal but then events gradually begin to weave a spell of psychological terror.
One night a ghost appears before the governess. It is the dead lover of Miss Jessel, the former governess. Later, the ghost of Miss Jessel herself appears before the governess and the little girl. Moreover, both the governess and the housekeeper suspect that the two spirits have appeared to the boy in private. The children, however, adamantly refuse to acknowledge the presence of the two spirits, in spite of indications that there is some sort of evil communication going on between the children and the ghosts.
Without resorting to clattering chains, demonic noises, and other melodramatic techniques, this elegantly told tale succeeds in creating an atmosphere of tingling suspense and unspoken horror matched by few other books in the genre. Known for his probing psychological novels dealing with the upper classes, James in this story tried his hand at the occult — and created a masterpiece of the supernatural that has frightened and delighted readers for nearly a century.",Paperback,87 p. ; 8.25 H x 0.25 D x 5.00 W inches 0.15 lbs.,0,,ENG,GENERAL,Fiction,813/.4,PS2116 .T8 1991,Dover Thrift Editions,Literature/Classics,FICTION / Classics,"Governesses; Fiction.

The two works were published together in 1794 with the subtitle, ""Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul.""
The poems of Songs of Innocence describe childhood states of naturalness and purity in delicately beautiful lyrics that reveal a child's unspoiled and beatific view of life and human nature. InSongs of Experience the mood and tone darken, the poems suggesting the bitter corruptions and disillusionment that await the innocent. The contrast between the two sets of lyrics is perhaps at its most acute in the poems ""The Lamb"" and ""The Tyger,"" the latter ultimately expressing wonderment at the seemingly paradoxical coexistence of good and evil.

In the central character of Nora, Ibsen epitomized the human struggle against the humiliating constraints of social conformity. Nora's ultimate rejection of a smothering marriage and life in ""a doll's house"" shocked theatergoers of the late 1800s and opened new horizons for playwrights and their audiences.
But daring social themes are only one aspect of Ibsen's power as a dramatist. A Doll's House shows as well his gifts for creating realistic dialogue, a suspenseful flow of events and, above all, psychologically penetrating characterizations that make the struggles of his dramatic personages utterly convincing.

The work of English clergyman, educator and Shakespearean scholar Edwin A. Abbott (1838-1926), it describes the journeys of A. Square, a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women-thin, straight lines-are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status.
Through strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions—a revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional world.

His fascination with that political rarity and his intense desire to see the Medici family assume a similar role in Italy provided the foundation for his ""primer for princes."" In this classic guide to acquiring and maintaining political power, Machiavelli used a rational approach to advise prospective rulers, developing logical arguments and alternatives for a number of potential problems, among them governing hereditary monarchies, dealing with colonies and the treatment of conquered peoples. Refreshing in its directness, yet often disturbing in its cold practicality, The Prince sets down a frighteningly pragmatic formula for political fortune. Starkly relevant to the political upheavals of the 20th century, this calculating prescription for power remains today, nearly 500 years after it was written, a timely and startling lesson in the practice of autocratic rule that continues to be much read and studied by students, scholars and general readers as well.",Paperback,"viii, 71 p. ; 8.25 H x 0.25 D x 5.25 W inches 0.15 lbs.",0,,ENG,GENERAL,Non-Fiction,320.1,JC143 .M3813 1992,Dover Thrift Editions,Philosophy,"PHILOSOPHY / Political

First published in installments in the London Magazine in 1821, the work recounts De Quincey's early years as a precocious student of Greek, his flight from grammar school and subsequent adventures among the outcasts and prostitutes of London, studies at Oxford University and his introduction to opium in 1804 (he hoped that taking the drug would relieve a severe headache). It was the beginning of a long-term addiction to opium, whose effects on his mind are revealed in remarkably vivid descriptions of the dreams and visions he experienced while under its influence.
Describing the general style of the Confessions, an English critic of the period wrote in theLondon Monthly Review: ""They have an air of reality and life; and they exhibit such strong graphic powers as to throw an interest and even a dignity round a subject which in less able hands might have been rendered a tissue of trifles and absurdities.""
In later years, De Quincey revised and expanded the first edition of the Confessions into a much longer, more verbose work which lacked the readable intensity of the original. The present edition reprints the first version, generally considered more impressive, and admired for its introspective penetration and journalistic astuteness.",Paperback,"v, 70 p. ; 8.25 H x 0.25 D x 5.25 W inches 0.15 lbs.",0,,ENG,GENERAL,Non-Fiction,828/.809,PR4534 .C6 1995,Dover Thrift Editions,Biography/Autobiography,BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Personal Memoirs,"De Quincey, Thomas,; 1785-1859.

The theatrical romp begins when Viola assumes the identity of Cesario, a page in the household of the Duke of Orsino. The Duke is enamored of the Countess Olivia, who spurns him for the newly arrived young page. The comical machinations of Malvolio, Sir Toby Belch, the maid Maria, and Sir Andrew Aguecheek add to the ensuing confusion — all of which is pleasantly resolved when Viola and Sebastian meet once again.

Besides this mutinous action, the king must also contend with the dissolute ways of his son, Prince Hal, who spends much of his time in the company of the witty, rotund, tavern-haunting Sir John Falstaff, one of Shakespeare's immortal comic characters. During the rebellion against his father, however, Hal acquits himself honorably in battle, portending the eventual transformation in later plays of the wild prince into a great warrior-king.
These various themes are woven together here in a superb blend of brilliantly staged scenes depicting the king's attempts to pacify the rebels and maintain his power, the plotting of Percy and other insurgents, grim action on the battlefield, and the low comedy of Falstaff and his comrades — all brought to life in some of Shakespeare's finest blank verse and raciest prose.",Paperback,"ix, 85 p. ; 8.50 H x 0.25 D x 5.25 W inches 0.20 lbs.",0,,ENG,GENERAL,Non-Fiction,822.3/3,PR2810 .A1 1997,Dover Thrift Editions,Plays,"DRAMA / European / English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh","Henry; IV,; King of England,; 1367-1413; Drama.

In 1774, he emigrated to America where, for a time, he helped to edit the Pennsylvania Magazine. On January 10, 1776, he published his pamphletCommon Sense, a persuasive argument for the colonies' political and economic separation from Britain.
Common Sense cites the evils of monarchy, accuses the British government of inflicting economic and social injustices upon the colonies, and points to the absurdity of an island attempting to rule a continent. Credited by George Washington as having changed the minds of many of his countrymen, the document sold over 500,000 copies within a few months.
Today, Common Sense remains a landmark document in the struggle for freedom, distinguished not only by Paine's ideas but also by its clear and passionate presentation. Designed to ignite public opinion against autocratic rule, the pamphlet offered a careful balance between imagination and judgment, and appropriate language and expression to fit the subject. It immediately found a receptive audience, heartened Washington's despondent army, and foreshadowed much of the phrasing and substance of the Declaration of Independence.",Paperback,"v, 58 p. ; 8.50 H x 0.25 D x 5.00 W inches 0.15 lbs.",1,,ENG,GENERAL,Non-Fiction,320.01/1,E211 .P1198 1997,Dover Thrift Editions,Politics/Intl Relations,"POLITICAL SCIENCE / History & Theory

Both structurally and psychologically compact, it is among the most expressive of the Russian playwright's dramatic works.
Set on an estate in nineteenth-century Russia, this deeply emotional tale of misplaced idealism and unrequited love concerns the complex interrelationships between a retired professor, his second wife, and his brother-in-law and daughter from a previous marriage. In deceptively mundane dialogue, the characters reveal their private tragedies — weakness and inability to communicate — the failures that lead them to lives of frustration and despair. Nevertheless, Chekhov's delineation of human frailties elicits sympathy for even the most irresolute and deluded characters, and the play's underlying message is one of courage and hope.

""I am a black man, born in Jamaica, B.W.I., and have been living in America for the last years. It was the first time I had ever come face to face with such manifest, implacable hate of my race, and my feelings were indescribable … Looking about me with bigger and clearer eyes I saw that this cruelty in different ways was going on all over the world. Whites were exploiting and oppressing whites even as they exploited and oppressed the yellows and blacks. And the oppressed, groaning under the leash, evinced the same despicable hate and harshness toward their weaker fellows. I ceased to think of people and things in the mass. [O]ne must seek for the noblest and best in the individual life only: each soul must save itself.""
So wrote the first major poet of the Harlem Renaissance, whose collection of poetry,Harlem Shadows (1922), is widely regarded as having launched the movement. But McKay's literary significance goes far beyond his fierce condemnations of racial bigotry and oppression, as is amply demonstrated by the universal appeal of his sonnet, ""If We Must Die,"" recited by Winston Churchill in a speech against the Nazis in World War II.
While in Jamaica, McKay produced two works of dialect verse, Songs of Jamaica andConstab Ballads, that were widely read on the island. In richly authentic dialect, the poet evoked the folksongs and peasant life of his native country. The present volume, meticulously edited and with an introduction by scholar Joan R. Sherman, includes a representative selection of this dialect verse, as well as uncollected poems, and a generous number in standard English fromHarlem Shadows.",Paperback,"xi, 52 p. ; 8.50 H x 0.25 D x 5.50 W inches 0.10 lbs.",0,,ENG,GENERAL,Non-Fiction,811/.52,PS3525.A24785 A6 1999,Dover Thrift Editions,Poetry,"POETRY / Caribbean & Latin American

The harsh endurance test of survival at sea, magnified by the dying sailor's condition, sends the crewmen through an emotional gamut, ranging from pity and selfless compassion to fear, resentment, and a profound hatred that boils perilously close to mutiny.
In this 1897 novel, a compelling examination of human character under conditions of extreme danger and stress, Joseph Conrad considers some of his customary preoccupations. His masterful narrative technique captures every nuance of atmospheric tension as it explores issues related to moral dilemmas, isolation, and the psychology of inner compulsions.

Here are the Four Truths that reveal the nature of the world and our lot in it; here also is the Eightfold Path, the way to enlightenment, incorporating the means to overcome the essential suffering revealed by the Four Truths as the essence of life. The Dhammapada serves as a coherent summation of the necessities for following the Eightfold Path as well as an encouraging and thought-provoking resource to consult along the way.

Falstaff, whose greed and vanity overwhelm his good sense, determines to seduce a pair of well-to-do country housewives. The portly knight meets his match among the gentlewomen of Windsor, however, who counter his every stratagem with witty maneuvers of their own that expose Sir John's tomfoolery to public mirth. Familiar Shakespearean themes and devices — romance, jealousy, disguises, and mistaken identities — enrich the plot, along with a sparkling cast of supporting characters, including rival wooers, informers, and witty go-betweens.

His witty, clever drama, populated by brilliant talkers skilled in the art of riposte and paradox, are still staples of the theatrical repertoire.
An Ideal Husband revolves around a blackmail scheme that forces a married couple to reexamine their moral standards — providing, along the way, a wry commentary on the rarity of politicians who can claim to be ethically pure. A supporting cast of young lovers, society matrons, an overbearing father, and a formidable femme fatale continually exchange sparkling repartee, keeping the play moving at a lively pace.
Like most of Wilde's plays, this scintillating drawing-room comedy is wise, well-constructed, and deeply satisfying.

The root of Sigmund Freud's approach to psychiatric treatment resides in bringing the id, the hidden source of human passion, to the surface. The ego — formed to negotiate the id's interactions with reality — and the superego — the critical, moralistic part of the mind — remain in constant conflict with the id's demands.
Although the concept of the unconscious was not Freud's own invention, he brought it into popular awareness and pioneered its use in treating mental conditions.

Here is the original tale of seven-year-old Marie and her beloved Nutcracker, beset by a dark mystery that surrounds this story within a story.
Godpapa Drosselmeier, who once served as the royal court's inventor, recounts to Marie a tale of the trickery of Dame Mouserink, the Queen of Mice.

His playful treatment of punctuation and language adds enduring zest to such popular and oft-anthologized poems as ""All in green went my love riding,"" ""in Just-,"" ""Tumbling-hair,"" ""O sweet spontaneous,"" ""Buffalo Bill's,"" and ""the Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls.""

These short stories (""Up in Michigan,"" ""Out of Season,"" and ""My Old Man"") and their accompanying poems captured the attention of other influential critics as well, anticipating the future Nobel Laureate's emergence as a prominent voice of the Modernist movement.
Succinct and lucid in his prose style, American novelist and short story writer Ernest Hemingway (1899–1961) exercised an enormous influence over English-language authors of the twentieth century. A member of the expatriate Lost Generation circle, Hemingway cultivated a larger-than-life image of vigorous masculinity complemented by an intense sensitivity. He drew upon his adventures as a big-game hunter, bullfighter, and fisherman for his fiction as well as his service as a World War I ambulance driver and a reporter during the Spanish Civil War and World War II.",Paperback,pages cm. 8.00 H x 5.00 W inches,1,,ENG,GENERAL,Fiction,813/.52,PS3515.E37 A6 2019,Dover Thrift Editions,Literature/Classics,LITERARY COLLECTIONS / American / General,LITERARY COLLECTIONS / American / General.,Book,BOOK,,5/1/2018

A 19-year-old student sent Rilke some of his verses, seeking an opinion of their worth. Rilke declined to offer a critique, instead encouraging the student to rely upon his own inner judgment: ""Nobody can advise and help you, nobody. There is only one single means. Go inside yourself.""
This seemingly dismissive letter proved to be the first of ten, written during a six-year period that coincided with an important stage in Rilke's artistic development. The poet offered his young correspondent further advice on developing a rich inner life as well as guidance on broader philosophical and existential issues. These letters, which explore many of the themes that later emerged in Rilke's best works, remain a captivating source of insights into the artistic identity and process.",Paperback,80 p. : 8.00 H x 5.00 W inches,1,,ENG,GENERAL,Non-Fiction,808,PN,Dover Thrift Editions,Literature/Classics,LITERARY COLLECTIONS / Letters,null,Book,BOOK,,10/23/2018

Rad Dad is, as always, about communication, about not shutting off when your kids need help making sense of the things happening around them. And sometimes that's the hardest part—when you yourself are fighting to make sense of a changing terrain. Says Tomas in the zine's intro, “For my family, there was violence in our neighborhood as a number of young men were killed, friends of ours were assaulted in their homes, domestic violence happened in a family we were close to. Suddenly, it seemed I was just trying to keep up with things?let alone talk about them with my kids. But they were listening; they were witnesses to it all and witnesses to how we, the adults in their lives, reacted.” The psychic landscape this issue navigates can be harrowing but Rad Dad retains the loving, constructive light of positivity and forward motion it has cultivated since issue 1.

Its nameless hero is a profoundly alienated individual in whose brooding self-analysis there is a search for the true and the good in a world of relative values and few absolutes. Moreover, the novel introduces themes — moral, religious, political and social — that dominated Dostoyevsky's later works.Notes from the Underground, then, aside from its own compelling qualities, offers readers an ideal introduction to the creative imagination, profundity and uncanny psychological penetration of one of the most influential novelists of the nineteenth century.

9780486424552,0486424553,0003950493,0003950493,"Goethe, Johann Wolfgang Von",The Sorrows of Young Werther,3.5,1.99,2,"One of the world's first bestsellers, this tragic masterpiece attained an instant and lasting success upon its 1774 publication, catapulting the author to the forefront of the German literary movement known asSturm und Drang. A burst of parodies, operas, poems, and plays based on The Sorrows of Young Werther rapidly ensued, along with the cultlike following of young romantics across Europe who affected the manner of the novel's passionate and self-destructive hero.
Young Werther bares his soul to readers in the form of alternately joyful and despairing letters about his unrequited love. His story marks the initial great achievement of what has since been termed ""confessional"" literature; Goethe, who based the story in part on his own unhappy love affair, acknowledged a sense of freedom upon completing the work. A sensitive exploration of the mind of a young artist, the tale addresses age-old questions — the meaning of love, of death, and the possibility of redemption — in the exuberant language of youth. 
""Werther appeared to seize the hearts of men in all quarters of the world, and to utter for them the word which they had long been waiting to hear,"" observed the Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle. Indeed, Goethe's portrayal ofZerrissenheit, ""the state of being torn apart, in which a character struggles to reconcile his artistic sensibilities with the demands of the objective world, proved tremendously influential to subsequent writers, andThe Sorrows of Young Werther continues to speak to modern readers.",Paperback,"vii, 88 p. ; 8.25 H x 0.50 D x 5.25 W inches 0.18 lbs.",0,,ENG,GENERAL,Fiction,833/.6,PT2027.W3 C37 2002,Dover Thrift Editions,Literature/Classics,FICTION / Classics,null,Book,BOOK,,12/25/2012

Spectators rioted during the premiere (and final) performance and unrelenting controversy over the play's meaning followed. The quality and stunning impact of the work, however, was never questioned.
Early drafts of the play were written by Jarry in his teens to ridicule one of his teachers. The farce was done in the form of stylized burlesque, satirizing the tendency of the successful bourgeois to abuse his authority and become irresponsibly complacent. Ubu — the cruel, gluttonous, and grotesque main character (the author's metaphor for modern man) — anticipated characteristics of the Dada movement. In the 1920s, Dadaists and Surrealists championed the play, recognizingUbu Roi as the first absurdist drama.",Paperback,"vi, 73 p. : 8.25 H x 0.25 D x 5.25 W inches 0.20 lbs.",0,,ENG,GENERAL,Non-Fiction,842/.8,PQ2619.A65 U313 2003,Dover Thrift Editions,Plays,DRAMA / European / French,null,Book,BOOK,,12/26/2012

Père Goriot — one of the outstanding novels in The Human Comedy, Balzac's panoramic study of Parisian life — features richly detailed settings, a skillfully related plot, and a vibrant cast of characters. Young Rastignac's acquaintance with the elderly widower Goriot, a formerly wealthy merchant impoverished by the demands of his fashionable daughters, lies at the heart of this story of love and greed.

From the musings of literary geniuses like Mark Twain inThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to the striking personal narrative of Harriet Jacobs inIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, this new series is a comprehensive collection of our literary history through the words of the exceptional few.

The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is perhaps the most widely read and well-known slave narrative. Originally published in 1845, the work was an instant success, selling more than 11,000 copies in the first three years. Written as a memoir of his life and experiences, the book addresses the issues of slavery from a firsthand perspective with a sage eloquence. The narrative draws from various points of Douglass’s life in stark detail: the cruelty he experienced as a slave, his escape to freedom, and how he became a famous orator and abolitionist.

Initially, early skeptics had a hard time accepting that such a profound text was written by an uneducated African American slave. However, this theory was quickly disproven when he spoke in public, famously giving extraordinarily articulate speeches.The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is no exception to Douglass’s vigor, poise, and wit he exemplified in his oration. Here is a story of a man who faced extreme hardship and adversity—and rose above it to write one of the most important and influential books in history.",Paperback,87 p. : 8.25 H x 0.50 D x 5.50 W inches 0.30 lbs.,1,United States,ENG,GENERAL,Non-Fiction,920,D,Clydesdale Classics,Biography/Autobiography,"BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Historical

“Do every deed, speak every word, think every thought in the knowledge that you may end your days any moment.”


“We have body, soul, and intelligence. To the body belong the senses, to the soul the passions, to the intelligence principles.”


“Think not as your insulter judges or wishes you to judge: but see things as they truly are.”


“To pursue impossibilities is madness; and it is impossible that the wicked should not act in some such way as this.”


“Order not your life as though you had ten thousand years to live. Fate hangs over you. While you live, while yet you may, be good.”

Meditations is a collection of twelve books written by Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. This set of book was originally compiled in the form of private journals. Marcus Aurelius used these notes as personal guides to live by and to better himself as a ruler. He compiled these journals during his time as emperor, and while they were not intended for public consumption, there are valuable lessons to be gleaned from his wisdom. The entries include his views of stoicism—the Hellenistic philosophy devoid of “destructive emotions” that could tamper with logic—and its practical use in ruling and military tactics.
